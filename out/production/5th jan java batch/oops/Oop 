1. Class
        -collection of objects
        -logical entity
        -Blueprint
        -does not consume any space
        -contains fields, method, constructors, blocks, nested classes &interface
        - eg. Cat-
                state -(color,name,breed) & behavior (running, eating,meow)

2. Object
        -real world entity
        -Instance of class
        -consume space
        -has state/property & behavior
        -it can be logical or physical
        -eg. Car,mobile,laptop
3. inheritance
        -when an object acquires all the the properties & behaviors of a parent object
        -provides code re-usability
        - used to run polymorphism
        - represents IS-A relationship
           eg. Dog is a animal
               Sparrow is a bird
               Cat is a animal
4. polymorphism
        - one task performed in different ways
        - eg. cat sound,dog sound,lion sound
5. Abstraction
        -Hiding of data and showing functionalities
6. Encapsulation
        Binding/wrapping of data into single unit

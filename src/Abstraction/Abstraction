    Notes:
        1. abstract class can have abstract methods or non abstract methods
        2. if class contain abstract method then class must be abstract
        3. class have static methods
        4. class also have finaldemo methods
        5. if any class extends abstract class then we have to implement abstract method or declare that class as abstract
        6. class does not instantiated (cannot create

        // diamond problem
        //
        // difference between abstract and interface
        abstract                                                                                                        interface
    1. we can have both method abstract and non-abstract
